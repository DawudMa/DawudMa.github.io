He has developed software to construct population distribution models through long time series Tencent location big data sets and dynamically monitor population distribution over large areas using VIIRS nighttime remote sensing data with LBS data to provide fundamental support for large-scale monitoring of tourism behavior. He has published two peer-reviewed journal articles on tourism demand and population modeling, including one article in a Q1 journal and one paper in a Q2 journal. He is majoring in the direction of tourism information flow theoretical system research. He actively contributes to numerous national science research projects in spatiotemporal big data mining and analysis, WebGIS visualization development, GIS map service development, etc.",
